function [success, oldResolution, currentResolution] = changeResolution(screenNumber, width, height, hz)
%function success=changeResolution(screenNumber, width, height, hz)
% The function checks for the screen screenNumber that width and height (in
% pixels) and refresh rate (hz in  hz) are an appropriate supported combination of resolution and then
% tries to change the screen to that resolution and refresh rate using PsychToolBox
% success can be 0 (fail), 1 (success), 2 neutral (did not change
% resolution but it is actually already correct)
